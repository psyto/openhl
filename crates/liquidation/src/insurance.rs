//! Insurance fund state machine (Stage 10b).
//!
//! The insurance fund is the venue's pooled buffer that absorbs the
//! deficit when a Liquidatable account's close turns underwater, or when
//! an Underwater account is liquidated outright. It accumulates the
//! liquidation fees that solvent closes pay in. Stage 10c's scanner will
//! own an [`InsuranceFund`] and call its deposit / withdraw operations
//! from the per-account liquidation loop.
//!
//! ### Why stateful here when the rest of the crate is pure
//!
//! Margin classification, fee math, and close-outcome computation
//! ([`crate::compute`]) are pure functions over per-account snapshots —
//! they can be re-evaluated lossless at any time. The insurance fund's
//! balance, in contrast, accumulates effects from many liquidation events
//! across many blocks; it is genuinely state. The shape mirrors
//! `openhl_funding::clock` — a small state machine, owned by the bridge,
//! mutated only on well-defined boundary events.
//!
//! ### Sign discipline
//!
//! The balance is `i64` internally for arithmetic uniformity with
//! [`crate::compute`], but the type invariant is **`balance ≥ 0`** —
//! every public operation preserves it. Withdrawals that exceed the
//! balance saturate at 0 and surface the unfilled portion via
//! [`WithdrawOutcome`]. Stage 10c's scanner reads the unfilled portion
//! as the trigger to escalate to ADL (Stage 10d).
//!
//! ### Deposit semantics
//!
//! `deposit` accepts a non-negative fee amount. Negative deposits are
//! treated as zero (saturating semantics, no panic) — defensive coding
//! against accidental misuse from the caller. Saturating-add caps at
//! `i64::MAX` for network-pathological accumulated balances.

/// The insurance fund's accumulating balance.
///
/// Owned by the bridge (Stage 10c+), exposed via deposit / withdraw
/// operations that maintain the `balance ≥ 0` invariant.
